## Goal I: Cognitive movement ecology

.pull-left[

> #### What is the importance of __memory__, __learning__, __sociality__, __perception__ in understanding how/why/where animals move?
  
**Read papers + discuss** 
(1 h / week)

We'll cycle through leading discussions of papers most weeks.

## Goal II: Analyze Data & Write Manuscript (2 h / week)

.pull-left-40[

> Do **memory** and **collective decision making** explain how caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*) select **wintering** grounds? 

> If so, **how**?

# Goals 
## January 18



---

# Based on readings

How is "cognition" defined?  

--

What are the most compelling examples of cognition driving movement?

--
    
Why is it hard to study cognitive movement ecology? 

--

What gives us the hope / chutzpah that we can study cognition in movement of **wild** animals?  

---

### Spatial Memory (Fagan et al. 2013)

### Spatial Memory (Fagan et al. 2013)

![](images/FaganFigure2.png)


---

### Recursion

Fagan et al. emphasize recursion as evidence of memory (with caveats).


**Question:** Is the seasonal migration phenomenon in itself necessarily proof of spatial memory?   If not, why not?   How would you parse those differences? 



---

## Gurarie 5-step criteria

.large[
- (A) identify an **observable behavior** that might be driven by prior experiences; 

- (B) identification of **experienced cues** that might influence that behavior; 

- (C) a **cognitive model**; i.e. a plausible functional relationship between movement response A to experience B; 

- (D) a **statistical method** (or pattern-matching heuristic) to estimate the model C; 

- (E) a **metric** for comparing the cognitive model against a non-cognitive model. 

]

> ## Can we use these as a guide for structuring our analysis?  


---

## Assignment: **Draft Intro**


.large[
Here is a proposed **paragraph** by **paragraph** outline for the Introduction:

1. Cognitive movement ecology is important and hard.

2. Seasonal migration / seasonal range choice is fundamental and important - could make a population resilient, could make a population vulnerable. 

3. Social and collective cues are important.

4. Caribou wintering grounds are important and variable and mysterious. 

5. What we will do that is novel. 


> **Individuals will pick one topic and draft one paragraph, will look up references, and report on that paragraph.**
