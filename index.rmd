## Goals

This workshop is dedicated to developing skills in animal movement analysis, with an aim to start with foundations and build to useful and original inference.  We will learn about the properties of movement data, how to load, explore, visualize, and manipulate movement data.  We will learn the  properties and parameters of some fundamental discrete and continuous time movement models, and how to estimate those models.  We will cover tools for segmentation, behavioral analisys, and home ranging. We will relate movements to spatial data and environmental covariates.

This is a **hands-on** course, where every day students will be expected to perform independent or group work on original problems, culminating in a final presentation of the progress made.  

## What to bring

**Bring data** if you have some!  And some **interesting ecological or behavioral questions** you are interested in exploring.  

If you don't have data that feels relevant, you can work with other participants on an in-class project.

We will be using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), which we assume *participants have experience using*.  Be sure **R** is installed, as well as (most likely) [Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), preferably recent versions.  

We'll also use a bunch of useful packages which we can install and load as needed.  

Bring enthusiasm! 


## Structure

The course will mix lectures on concepts, theory and tools with practical labs using R. We will plan on covering roughly 2 topics per day in a morning (**8:00-11:30 am**) and afternoon (**1:30-5:00 pm**) session, with a mix of lecture and R labs for each.  We will also set aside time every day for participants to apply some of the techniques to their own data (alone or in groups) in a workshop-type atmosphere.  We will culminate with some brief presentations of some of the analysis performed by individuals / groups.  

The outline of the course below is approximate.  We'll be posting links to materials (lecture and labs) as the course proceeds.
