```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, 
                      cache = TRUE)
```

# Goal

> To estimate the sinuousity index

Packages:

```{r, cache = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
library(sf)
library(adehabitatHR)
library(mapview)
```


# Selecting some animals

```{r loadData, echo = -1}
setwd("../")
load("./data/elk_processed.rda")
head(elk_gps)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
